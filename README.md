Videos lister at albertyw.mit.edu/videos

This is a pretty old project that I developed to catalogue and distribute 
videos that I hoped would be better than just setting up an ftp server.  

It used to pull in videos from various sources and have them stream 
to the user.  Now, it just catalogues files on my own server.
